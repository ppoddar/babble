<h1>Distributed System</h1>
<span class='dropcap'>D</span>istributed system is an interconnected collection of component services.
The user of distributed system sees the entire collection of services as
a single service. However, the user-visible service is a composition of
behavior of individual components. Often, 
behavior emerges in a distributed system by composition that are new to 
any of its components.


<h1>Architecture of Distributed System</h1>

Architecture of a distributed system is described 
in terms of
three C's:

<span class='dropcap'>c</apan>omponent implements a specific set of functions.
A component is independent of the distributed system. It can operate
on its own and often executes in a process. 
 
<br>
This proerty allows a component to be developed independently and 
be part of multiple
distributed systems.  We will refer these components as <b>micro-service</b>.
<br>
A micro-service has own life-cycle and can fail
and/or its services become unavaialble.
However,
a distributed system should be able to function even without some components. 
<br>
A micro-service is described in terms of its functions. 
A function is referred
by a name and a set of input arguments. 
An external agency invokes function of a micro-service by name and
supplying the input arguments in the form of octates.
<br>
The sender does not assume any knowledge of intrnal operation of 
the target component. So, the input to a function are sent as octates
and not in any specific language object or encoding (such as serialized 
Java language objects).
<br>
The target component receives and interprets the octates and generates a response 
(again in octate form). that the external agency must be able to interpret.

The octate form accepted by a component for input and octate form in its
outut are two major aspect of function definition.

The response is asynchronous. The sender or external agency is not supposed to wait
for an response. Because as sender and target component communicates
via a network channel, if external agency waits for a response from the target
component, the network channel would be blocked from any other usage.
Also a sender must assume the target component to have an independent 
life cycle i.e. a sender must be able to account for situations where 
either the target component never responds or never receives the original request. 
 


connection: the nature of connection between component services is
a distinguish characteristic of a distributed system.

Bus
Recursive
Spaghetti

connction not only determines the physical channels of
communication but also communication protocol between the components. Though
physical connectivity and communication protocol ar related, but they are
distinct aspects of connction architure 

publish-subscribe
request-response
 
composition refers to aggregating responses of individual components into a
single cohesive response. Composition must account for fault, because a
distributed system should be able to produce a response even when 
individual component services may faulter or may not respond at all.
